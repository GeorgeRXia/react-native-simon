# react-native-simon
*This project was done in ten day, so it was not coded in best practice. I am right now refactoring the code, and will be done on July 17, 2017*


Technologies: React Native, Rails, Node websockets.

This projects requires you to also run the rails backend linked here:<a href='https://github.com/GeorgeRXia/simon_backend'> Simon Rails Backend</a>



This project's multiplayer mode requires:

1. You should NPM install
2. Go into the server folder and run NPM start for the websockets.
3. Start the rails server with rails s.
4. A way to run two simulators at once. I used Xcode and this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38099010/running-multiple-ios-simulators-with-react-native"> link </a>.
If using that link I suggest for the devices to be iphone 5s and iphone 6 plus, since some simulators do not work well together.
